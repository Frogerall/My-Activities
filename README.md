HTML/CSS Activities assigned by SupersimpleDev from YouTube.

On this Crash Course my knowledge on HTML/CSS was refresh and became more solid due to this Youtuber.

After teaching something he always make sure that his viewer can keep up and solidify their knowledge about it by giving us some activities to do!

Big Thanks for this Youtuber!
