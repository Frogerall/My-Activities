# HTML/CSS Activities

HTML/CSS Activities assigned by SupersimpleDev from YouTube. On this Crash Course, my knowledge of HTML/CSS was refreshed and became more solid due to this Youtuber.

After teaching something, he always makes sure that his viewers can keep up and solidify their knowledge by providing activities.

A big thanks to this Youtuber!
